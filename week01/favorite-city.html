    <h1>My Favorite City </h1>
    <p>Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire, is a vibrant and dynamic city located along the Ébrié Lagoon on
        the
        Atlantic coast. Often referred to as the "Paris of West Africa," it is known for its modern skyline, bustling
        markets,
        and rich cultural scene. As the country’s largest city, Abidjan serves as a hub for finance, commerce, and
        transportation in the region. Neighborhoods like Plateau, Cocody, and Treichville each offer a unique glimpse
        into the
        city's diversity, from business centers and universities to lively music and nightlife. With its mix of
        traditional
        Ivorian culture and contemporary urban life, Abidjan stands out as a symbol of resilience and growth in West
        Africa.</p>
